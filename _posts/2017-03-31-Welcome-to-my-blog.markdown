title: "ARE WE LIVING OR SURVIVING?"

##Are humans really stuck in the blind race to be born, eat, live, grow and finally die, or is there something more to life than that?

 Life is quite mysterious. For some it is amazing, adventurous and interesting. For others it is just a boring journey, which they keep on dragging till the end, called death, arrives.
 
Ever wondered what is the root cause of this dual thinking? Well, the answer lies within two very simple words – LIVING and SURVIVING.

I agree to the fact that ‘survival’ is a blind race, but my friend, I assure you that ‘living’ is not any blind race!

When we are born, there is a whole new world ahead of us. For some it is consider to be good, for others it is bad. And eating is the basic amenity for our survival, which does not come under the category of a race. It is the most basic requirement of any living organism. Slowly, we grow old, as per our biological anatomy, which again, is not any race, but rather a process defined and designed by the nature.

We are born. We eat. We grow up. But, we grow up differently. Some live. Others survive. Those who live, consider life as an adventurous journey. But those who survive, consider life as a mere blind race.

The difference between living life and surviving life is that when you live your life, you enjoy it to its fullest potential, be positive, and make sure nothing holds you back. This is how great people are formed. Surviving life is where you only require the necessaries, you pull through but not necessarily enjoying it.

Animals can only survive, they can’t live. So if you are doing the same, then what is the difference? And we all know the fact that death is inevitable. Every journey has an end. Every path has a halt. Which again, is the end of the ‘race’ called survival.

Human life is meant to be exciting. It is meant to ‘Live’ each moment to the fullest. Dreaming. Imagining. Because life is an adventurous game and if you don’t play it, it is you who are to be blamed.

So, in a nutshell, you are stuck in a race, only if you THINK that you are stuck in the race.

Enjoy your life. Have a nice day! :)
